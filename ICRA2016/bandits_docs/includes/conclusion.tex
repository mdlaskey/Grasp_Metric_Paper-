\section{Discussion and Future Work}
\seclabel{conclusion}
We introduced the Dexterity Network (Dex-Net) 1.0, a dataset of approximately 20,000 3D object models and a network of similarity between object models and parallel-jaw grasps on each model.
We extended the Multi-Armed Bandit model of Laskey et al.~\cite{laskey2015bandits} to leverage similiarty between grasps based on gripper pose, local surface geometry encoded as heightmaps, and global shape similarity encoded using a state-of-the-art method for shape retrieval based on multi-view Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)~\cite{su2015multi}.
Our experiments suggest that increasing the amount of prior knowledge of objects and the quality of grasps on each object enables up to a $10\times$ speedup in the time to select a grasp with high probability of force closure for a new object, and also suggest that convergence is fastest when the object has a set of geometrically similar nearest neighbors in the database.

One current shortcoming of our method is that it relies on a set of features manually designed to predict grasp quality for a grasp and object, such as heightmaps and CNNs that predict object category.
Future work will leverage recent developments in feature optimization with deep neural networks~\cite{levine2015end} to optimize feature representations of both the local and global surface geometry based on the outcome of grasp evaluations in the bandit algorithms.
We will also study extensions of the shape similarity neural network to predict object class from simulated depth images of objects on a table, which could be useful for transferring learned data from Dex-Net to objects in the physical world.

Another shortcoming is our current use of wrench space metrics, which have been criticized recently for not correlating with human labels~\cite{kappler2015leveraging} or physical trials~\cite{balasubramanian2012physical}.
However, both forms of labels may be difficult to acquire for the entire dataset because of the human and time cost involved.
Future work will research using Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs) to actively acquire grasp evaluations uncertain objects.
To do so, we will study using functional map networks to establish consistent maps between prototypical object parts that indicate grasp affordance, such as handles
We will also build on recent developments in caging to label key the dataset with caging hand configurations either analytically, using simulation, or using a learned model to predict caging configurations.
We will also work toward releasing Dex-Net as an open-access project with an open-source API for labelling objects in the Cloud with analytic quality metrics or simulation outcomes, integrating Dex-Net with physical robots, and learning statistical models of grasp success using deep learning and MAB.
