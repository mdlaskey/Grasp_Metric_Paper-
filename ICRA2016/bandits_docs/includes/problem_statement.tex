Let $\bg = [\bx, \bw]^T$ be a parallel-jaw grasp parameterized by its center in 3D space $\bx \in \mathbb{R}^3$ and approach direction $\bv \in \mS^2$.
Let $\mG = \{ [\bx, \bw]^T \big| \bx \in \mathbb{R}^3,  \}$ denote the space of all grasps.
%We will assume a fixed set of candidate grasps $\Gamma = \{ g_1, ..., g_N\}$.
%Ideally the candidate set would form a cover of the which may be generated via Gaussian pose sampling~\cite{} or heur.

We will assume a known object shape $\nu$, and known uncertainty in object pose, gripper pose, and friction coefficient resulting from sensing uncertainties and missing data following the model of Laskey et al.~\cite{laskey2015bandits}. 
%Let $\upsilon$ be a random variable representing object shape represented by a Gaussian Process implicit surface~\cite{} distribution over signed distance fields $f$ with mean $\mu_f \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times M}$ and covariance $\Sigma_f$.
Let $\xi$ be uncertainty in object pose distributed as a Gaussian with mean $\mu_{\xi} \in \mathfrak{se}(3)$ and covariance $\Sigma_{\xi}$.
Let $\rho$ be uncertainty in gripper pose distributed as a Gaussian with mean $\mu_{\rho} \in \mG$ and covariance $\Sigma_{\rho}$.
Let $\zeta$ denote uncertiainty in friction coefficient distributed as a Gaussian with mean $\mu_{\zeta} \in \mathbb{R}$ and covariance $\Sigma_{\zeta}$.
Given object shape and samples of object pose, and gripper pose, we let $\bc_i(\bg, \theta, \xi, \rho) \in \mathbb{R}^3$ for $i \in {1, 2}$ denote the 3D location of contact between the $i$-th gripper jaw and surface.
Furthermore, let $\bn_i(\bc_i, \nu) \in \mS^2$ denote the surface normal at this contact.
A graphical model describing the relationship between these quantities is given in~\figref{graphical-model}.

We measure grasp quality by the probability of force closure subject to these uncertain quantities.
Let $F \in \{0, 1\}$ denote the occurence of force closure, or the ability to resist wrenches in arbitrary directions~\cite{ferrari1992}.
Then the probability of force closure for a grasp $\bg$ is
%\vspace{-2ex}
\begin{align*}
	P_F(\bg) = \mathbb{P}\left(F = 1 \mid \bg, \xi, \rho, \zeta \right).
\end{align*}
\noindent We are interested in finding the candidate grasp that maximizes the probability of force closure $P_F(g)$~\cite{kim2012physically, laskey2015bandits, mahler2015gp, weisz2012pose} subject to these sources of uncertainty over a budgeted maximum number of samples $T$.
To perform this as q	uickly as possible we formulate this as a maximization over the sum of the true $P_F$ for the grasps sampled at iteration $t$, where $I(i)$ denotes the grasp selected at time $t$

\vspace{-2ex}
\begin{align}
	\maximum{g_{I(1)}, ..., g_{I(T)} \in \mG} \sum \limits_{t=1}^T P_F(g_{I(t)}) \label{eq:objective}
\end{align}

\noindent As the maximization over the continuous space $\mG$ is computationally expensive, past work has solved this objective using a discrete set of $K$ candidate grasps $\Gamma = \left\{ \bg_1, ..., \bg_K \right\}$.
In practice $\Gamma$ has been set using Gaussian sampling of grasp centers and poses~\cite{laskey2015bandits} or using heuristics such as antipodality~\cite{mahler2015opt}.
\TODO{Switch to task-based quality metric (e.g. resiting gravity)? I think it would be more compelling but doesn't seem to have much precedent}

Even with a discrete set of candidates, evaluating $P_F(\bg)$ for any grasp requires an expensive integration over possible contact locations between the grasp and surface and the surface normals at these contacts~\cite{mahler2015gp}.
Thus, past work has evaluated the probability of force closure using Monte-Carlo integration~\cite{kehoe2012estimating, kehoe2012toward, weisz2012pose}, approximating the expression by minimzing uncertainty at the contact locations~\cite{mahler2015gp}, and using Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms to jointly evaluate $P_F(\bg)$ using Monte-Carlo integration while allocating samples to more promising grasps.
In this work, we propose to use Multi-Armed Bandits with correlations between arms to further accelerate convergence.
