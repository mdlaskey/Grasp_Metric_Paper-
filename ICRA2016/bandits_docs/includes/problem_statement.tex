\section{Definitions and Problem Statement}
\seclabel{problem}

Let $g \in \mathfrak{se}(3)$ denote an attempted pose of the robot end-effector in 3D space, and $\Gamma = \{ g_1, ..., g_N\}$ denote a set of candidate grasps.
Let $\upsilon$ denote uncertainty in object shape represented by a Gaussian Process implicit surface~\cite{} distribution over signed distance fields $f$ with mean $\mu_f \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times M}$ and covariance $\Sigma_f$.
Let $\xi$ denote Gaussian uncertainty in object pose with mean $\mu_{\xi} \in \mathfrak{se}(3)$ and covariance $\Sigma_{\xi}$.
Let $\rho$ denote Gaussian uncertainty in gripper pose with mean $\mu_{\rho} \in \mathfrak{se}(3)$ and covariance $\Sigma_{\rho}$.
Let $\zeta$ denote Gaussian uncertiainty in friction coefficient mean $\mu_{\zeta} \in \mathbb{R}$ and covariance $\Sigma_{\zeta}$.

We are interested in finding the candidate grasp that maximizes the probability of force closure $P_F(g) = \mathbb{P} \left( F = 1 \big| g, \upsilon, \xi, \rho, \zeta\right)$~\cite{} subject to these sources of uncertainty over a budgeted maximum number of samples $T$.
To perform this as q	uickly as possible we formulate this as a maximization over the sum of $P_F$ for the grasps sampled at iteration $t$.

\end{align*}

\noindent Laskey et al.~\cite{} proposed to solve this objective using algorithms for Multi-Armed Bandits.
In this work, we propose to use Multi-Armed Bandits with correlations between arms to further accelerate convergence.
